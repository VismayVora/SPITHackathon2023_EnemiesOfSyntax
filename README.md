Social Media platforms in general have access to a lot of our personal information that is stored on centralized servers that are prone to security threats. Build a decentralized platform that allows users to share their opinions and feelings online while considering the above.

It consists of Ethereum Blockchain, Django Backend Server and React as the frontend.

Hardhat is used for creating a local blockchain and deploying it to the local test network.
